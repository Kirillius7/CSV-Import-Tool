# About the project
This project is a web application designed to work with CSV files and manage data in a database. Users can upload CSV files to quickly import large datasets. Once uploaded, the records are stored in the database and displayed in a user-friendly table format. The application also provides inline editing, allowing users to update specific fields directly within the table. In addition, records can be deleted when no longer needed.

# Key Features
- **CSV Uploading:** Import data directly from CSV files into the database.
- **Data Management:**: Add new records, update existing ones, and delete unnecessary entries.
- **Inline Editing:** Edit table rows directly in the browser without reloading the page.
- **Search & Filtering:** Quickly find specific records using a built-in filter.
- **Sorting:** Sort table data by columns (text, numbers, or dates).
- **Error Handling:** Validation and clear error messages for invalid or corrupted CSV files.
